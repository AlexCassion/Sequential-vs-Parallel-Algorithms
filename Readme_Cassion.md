Based on our results, we noticed that sequential algorithms are actually faster when the dataset is small. For example, in 1,000 elements, the sequential sort was almost instant while the parallel version took longer. I think this is because of the overhead in creating processes.

When we increased the dataset to 100,000, the times became almost the same. But in 1,000,000 elements, the parallel sort became faster than the sequential one. So I think parallel algorithms are only useful when the data is large enough.

For searching, the sequential version was always faster. Maybe because linear search is already simple and doesn’t need parallelism.
