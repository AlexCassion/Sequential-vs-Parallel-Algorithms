From our experiment, sequential algorithms are more straightforward and easier to implement. Parallel algorithms are more complex because of synchronization and communication between processes.
Looking at the results, parallel sorting became useful only at 1,000,000 elements. Before that, it didn’t really improve performance. Also, in the sorted case, sequential was faster, probably because it didn’t need extra processing.
Parallel searching didn’t perform well in any dataset size. So not all algorithms benefit from parallelization.
